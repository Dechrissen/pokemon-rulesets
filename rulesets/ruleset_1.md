Jump to: [Rules](#rules) | [Philosophy behind this ruleset](#background-and-philosophy) | [Clarifying points](#clarifying-points) | [Randomizer settings](#randomizer-settings) | [Resources](#resources)

## Rules
Number | Rule | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
1 | Randomize all Pokémon | This includes starter, wild, trainer, gift, and purchased Pokémon.
2 | Randomize all field items | All items in the field are random, and all TMs in the field are replaced with a different TM.
3 | Party cap reduced to 4 | You may not have more than 4 main party Pokémon at a time.
4 | No catching Pokémon unless you have less than the cap | You may not catch a non-HM slave / main party Pokémon unless you have less than the maximum allowed. If you have the maximum already: in order to replace one, it either needs to die, or you can elect to sacrifice it by depositing it in a Box.
5 | No wild XP gain | You may not train on wild Pokémon; only trainers.
6 | No rematches | You may not re-fight any trainers via the VS Seeker or others means.
7 | Permadeath | If a Pokémon faints, it's considered dead. It must be deposited in a Box and can't be withdrawn.
8 | Black out = game over | If all of your main party Pokémon faint, you lose.
9 | One-try fully complete Gyms | Once you enter a gym, you cannot leave until you defeat all its trainers and the Leader.
10 | One-try important challenges | Once you begin an [important challenge](#important-challenges-and-their-win-conditions), you may not leave the building or otherwise interrupt the challenge to heal/gather items/etc. until you complete its goal.
11 | No shops (with exceptions) | No purchasing in shops, except for Pokéballs, repels, evolutionary stones, and Pokémon. ([What counts as a shop?](#shops))
12 | No 580+ BST Pokémon | You may not use a Pokémon as a main party Pokémon if its base stat total is 580 or higher. If a party member would evolve into one that fits this criterion, you must cancel the evolution.
13 | No in-battle use of HMs | You may not use HMs in battle.
14 | No using banned items | [Banned item list](#banned-item-list)
15 | No trading | Trades, including in-game trades, are banned.
16 | No growing berries | You may not grow berries for harvesting. If a pre-existing tree has berries on it, you may harvest from that tree one time.
17 | No daycare | You may not utilize the daycare.
18 | No using Pokémon with banned abilities | [Banned ability list](#banned-ability-list)
19 | HM slaves | You may have any number of HM slaves in your party. They may not be used in battle. If one gets sent out via a move like Whirlwind, you must immediately switch back to any main party Pokémon. HM slaves may not become main party Pokémon.
20 | No heal stations during important challenges | You may not use beds or healing stations during important challenges, e.g. in Silph Co.
21 | No stealing items | You may not steal items from wild Pokémon via moves like Thief.

## Background and philosophy
I have been developing challenge rulesets like this for a while without actually trying them in-game. I've always wanted a more difficult version of the game I love (the Gen 1-4 games, mostly). I don't like a lot of decisions made in other rulesets, like "Nuzlocke" and "Ironmon". So I decided to organize this particular ruleset into a nice markdown document, so I can share it with others.

The philosophy of this ruleset is **difficulty increase constrained by the realism of the Pokémon world**, i.e. it's meant to be a more challenging version of the vanilla game, without changing things that violate the "laws" of the Pokémon universe (as I see them). It's also not meant to be impossibly difficult.

For example, I do not believe randomization (of encountered Pokémon) is necessarily a violation of these laws rather than a simple habitat swap; but **to randomize stats, abilities, and movesets inherent to different species of Pokémon is a violation of some natural phenomena in the Pokémon universe** (the ones which make Pokémon "actual" Pokémon, and not some fan-made abomination).

Randomizing the species of Pokémon you encounter in the wild and from trainers can be a nice change. It lets you see and battle against Pokémon you traditionally wouldn't get much exposure to in a vanilla playthrough. But I think changing the you see in certain environments in the region is enough; you don't *need* to change properties inherent to them.

Essentially, I think certain parameters should be constant. If you're trying to develop a more challenging version of a game you love, you wouldn't change the geography or the story, for example. That would change it into something different. I think the same logic applies to changing properties of individual Pokémon, to the effect that they're no longer the Pokémon you have come to know. I believe this is at least the case when trying to create a ruleset which aims to make the game harder while preserving some core elements that make up the game's reality.

So, beyond the randomization aspect, the rest of the decisions I've made are meant to make the game harder in a way that would make sense. Thus, rules like permadeath made it into my ruleset. It makes sense; instead of fainting, Pokémon go away forever, which is more of a threat. So you should be careful in your battles. Reducing the max party size is meant to make it harder for you to achieve type coverage, so you should curate your party based on that constraint. The decision to ban Pokémon above BST 580 effectively eliminates the possibility of using legendaries, which makes sense, when you think about it in terms of the "realism" I mentioned earlier. Why would you have access to such powerful Pokémon in the wild, and why would the enemy trainers? 

When it comes to enemy trainers, I tried to make choices that would make them generally harder, without making them overpowered. The ruleset gives them the "better movesets" option in the randomizer, which doesn't give them access to moves they couldn't normally get, but instead gives them good moves they wouldn't typically have in a vanilla playthrough but realistically *could* have (like TM moves and egg moves). Boss trainers, such as gym leaders and team bosses, will have a held item on their strongest Pokémon. (Wouldn't you have at least one item on your Pokémon?)

## Clarifying points

### Questions you might have
Q: Can I use Pokémon Centers?
> Yes.

> Yes. And yes, you can purchase coins at the Game Corner.

Q: Can I use items anywhere (in battle and in the field)?
> Yes.

Q: What do I do if I run into a Pokémon in the wild?
> If you don't want to catch it, just try to run. If you can't, you can kill it. Just don't exploit this for XP gain.

Q: Can I catch more than one Pokémon per area?
> Yes, just as long as you don't violate Rule 4 (not catching Pokémon unless you have less than the cap).
